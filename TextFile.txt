Need to do:
	

Nice to have:

	add error handling and logging
	set up the database more correctly doing lazy loading and 
		don't set up a bunch of serverside code when you could do
		all that with the database
	you could store the side panel status in the local storage.
	Make it so that the user can remove the comments and screenshots that they add
	validation for date entering
	search and sort functionality for bugs
	add who uploaded a screenshot and when to the screenshots section
	crop pictures before uploading
	upload picture to storage/resize them (possibly firebase like I did before)
		and then somehow get a date sent to the view to show when the picture was added
		use an image processing library to make a thumbnail and then use that as the link to the slideshow
		this will probably all be possible with adding an image storage somewhere
	Make a feed page that shows the events that have happened in the project and allows you to 
		add comments about each happening
	Make it so that a comment can only be edited by the creator, but able to be deleted by the admin/manager
	maybe do a hub just for time on the comment 
	implement signalR for bugs
	implement signalR for projects
