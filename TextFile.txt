Need to do:
	
	for the addBug view do a loop through the files and make multiple canvas elements
	then do the ajax call with a progress bar to show the files being uploaded and then 


	remove screenshots from the model that it is in and then make
	it its own object and have them loaded independently so that they can
	be made an ajax call 



Nice to have:

	you could store the side panel status in the local storage.
	Make it so that the user can remove the comments and screenshots that they add
	validation for picture uploads and date entering
	search and sort functionality for bugs
	add who uploaded a screenshot and when to the displaying screenshots
	Preview/croph pictures before uploading
	upload picture to storage/resize them (possibly firebase like I did before)
		and then somehow get a date sent to the view to show when the picture was added
		use an image processing library to make a thumbnail and then use that as the link to the slideshow
		this will probably all be possible with adding an image storage somewhere
	Make a feed page that shows the events that have happened in the project and allows you to 
		add comments about each happening
	Make it so that a comment can only be edited by the creator, but able to be deleted by the admin/manager
	maybe do a hub just for time on the comment 
	implement signalR for bugs
	implement signalR for projects
