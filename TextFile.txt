Need to do:
implement signalR for the comment system- done! (really cool!!)
	maybe do a hub just for time on the comment 
	
implement signalR for bugs
implement signalR for projects


Nice to have:

you could store the side panel status in the local storage.
Make it so that the user can remove the comments and screenshots that they add
validation for picture uploads and date entering
search and sort functionality for bugs
Preview/crop pictures before uploading
upload picture to storage/resize them (possibly firebase like I did before)
	and then somehow get a date sent to the view to show when the picture was added
	use an image processing library to make a thumbnail and then use that as the link to the slideshow
	this will probably all be possible with adding an image storage somewhere
Make a feed page that shows the events that have happened in the project and allows you to 
	add comments about each happening
Make it so that a comment can only be edited by the creator, but able to be deleted by the admin/manager
