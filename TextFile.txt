Need to do:

set up demo accounts

then publish!!!!!!!!!!!


Nice to have:

you could store the side panel status in the local storage.
Make it so that the user can remove the comments and screenshots that they add
validation for picture uploads and date entering
search and sort functionality for bugs
Preview/crop pictures before uploading
upload picture to storage/resize them (possibly firebase like I did before)
	and then somehow get a date sent to the view to show when the picture was added
	use an image processing library to make a thumbnail and then use that as the link to the slideshow
	this will probably all be possible with adding an image storage somewhere
Make a feed page that shows the events that have happened in the project and allows you to 
	add comments about each happening
