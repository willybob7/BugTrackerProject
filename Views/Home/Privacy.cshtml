<h3>Comments feature</h3>
<p>When a comment is posted, the comment, the creation time, and the user-selected username are stored. This is for our security as we may be prosecuted for illegal content on our website even when it is created by users.</p>
<h3>Newsletter</h3>
<p>
    The information entered when signing up for our newsletter is used solely for this purpose. Subscribers may also be informed by email about any circumstances relevant to this service or the registration process, such as changes to the newsletter service or technical issues.<br />
    We require a valid email address for effective registration. In order to verify that a subscription actually originates from the owner of an email address, we use closed-loop opt-in email authentication. This involves recording the newsletter subscription request, transmission of the confirmation email, and receipt of the requested reply. Additional information is not collected. This information is used solely for delivery of the newsletter and is not shared with any third party.<br />
    You have the right to revoke your consent to allow us to store and use your personal information for sending the newsletter at any time. The relevant link for this is provided in each newsletter. You may also unsubscribe at any time directly via this website or send us your request via the contact option provided at the end of this privacy policy.

<h3>Use of Google Analytics</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (hereinafter: Google). Google Analytics uses cookies. These are text files stored on your computer to facilitate analysis of how you use this website. Information created by these cookies about your use of this website is generally sent to and stored on Google servers located in the USA. If you are located in the European Union or in a signatory country of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, IP anonymization is used on these web pages to shorten your IP address before transmission. Only in exceptional cases will the complete IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google uses this information on behalf of the operator of this website to analyze your usage of this website for the purpose of compiling website activity reports. It is also used for additional services associated with website and internet usage provided by the website operator. Google does not associate the IP address transmitted by your browser with other data within the scope of Google Analytics.</p>
<p>
    You can change your browser setting to prevent the storage of cookies. However, doing so may also prevent you from using some or all features provided by this website. You can prevent Google from collecting and processing data generated by cookies and data related to your use of this website (incl. your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plugin available from the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=debrowser" target="_blank">add-on for deactivating Google Analytics</a>.<br />
</p>
<h3>Use of script libraries (Google Webfonts)</h3>
<p>
    Part of correctly displaying this website’s content in a graphically appealing way across multiple browsers involves the use of script and font libraries, including Google Webfonts (<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/webfonts/</a>). Google Webfonts are cached in your browser to avoid having to load them multiple times. If your browser doesn’t support Google Webfonts, or prevents their access, a standard font is used instead.<br />
    Calling script or font libraries automatically establishes a connection to the library operator. It is theoretically possible for library operators to collect data. However, it is unclear if and for which purpose they do.
</p>
<p>The data privacy policy of the library operator Google is available here: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></p>
